const fullMessage = `i just wanted to take a bit of time to say thank you. thank you for staying, for being patient, and for choosing to go through everything with me. weâ€™ve shared a lot of ups and downs. not everything was easy, and some days felt heavier than others. but even on the rough days, we stayed. and i think thatâ€™s what helped us grow. and even when things havenâ€™t been easy, you still stayed. that means more than i can explain.\n
\nweâ€™ve been through a lot, and honestly, there were times we didnâ€™t really know what to do or how to handle things. pero kahit ganoâ€™n, we still showed up for each other. maybe not perfectly, but genuinely. and i think that says a lot.\n
\nlately, iâ€™ve really appreciated how youâ€™ve been more open, even in small ways. you probably donâ€™t even notice it, but i do. and it helps me feel closer to you.\n
\ni still choose you. and i still want to stay with you. this isnâ€™t something i take lightly â€” itâ€™s something i want to keep building with you, slowly but surely. we have things to look forward to, and that gives me a quiet kind of hope.\n
\nalso, i still think about that random thing you said before â€” you know what iâ€™m talking about. still makes me smile, every time.\n
\nthatâ€™s it. no big words, just really grateful to be here with you.\n
\nlove,\nme`;
